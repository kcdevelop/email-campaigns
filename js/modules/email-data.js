            'I am currently a first-year PGCPS (provisional) Drama Teacher seeking to transfer to a school that can facilitate an environment for me to further develop as an educator—while achieving my creative goals for students. At my current school, I have amalgamated the Comprehensive Middle School Drama curriculum to provide scholars with a well-rounded introduction to Theatre—including Scenic Design, Theatrical Lighting, and Acting (Meisner Technique). Upon discovering my knack for teaching younger scholars, I was assigned elementary classes, including first, second, and fourth grade. Additionally, I facilitated an afterschool <a style="font-weight: semi-bold; color: #000; text-decoration: underline !important;" href="https://sites.google.com/view/acv-gallery/home" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000;">Drama Club</span></a> for scholars with a strong interest in performance. I am seeking a school that has or is open to allowing me to build a Theatre Arts program. One of my near-term goals is to develop a traveling troupe that would perform one-act plays throughout and beyond the county&apos;s schools.'
